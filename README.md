# The Library Takes You around the World
In celebration of International Education Week, the King Library invites you on a tour of the globe. Follow along on an interactive map to learn how the libraryâ€™s collections and services bring ideas, influences, and culture from around the world to the SJSU community. We hope this exhibit inspires you to dig deeper into all the library has to offer.
